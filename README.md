# XamarinProjects

This project contains a solution to the problem expressed in the PDF also contained within this repository.

Not much work was done in the IOS project, since I don't have access to an apple product.

The solution contains a newsreader application for android and windows, that allows the user to read from an RSS feed provided by DR. The user may also add filters which decides which content he/she receives.
